I was always fascinated by the Facial Recognition and Ai/Machine learining in general.
This is my experiment on Face Recognition using TensorFlow and Rust
This will allows you to identified a faces or a series inside an image.
If you want to try it use the following command:
cargo run [image-source] [image-destination]
